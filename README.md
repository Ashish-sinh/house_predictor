# House Price Prediction üè†üí∞

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. The machine learning model has been trained and deployed using Streamlit and scikit-learn. By leveraging this model, users can estimate the price of a house based on various features.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.9
- numpy
- pandas 
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found scikit-learn it self by doint sklear.datasets import fetch_california_housing(). It includes various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location, which are used to predict house prices.

## Visit the APP
To use the deployed model, visit the following link: [House Price Predictor](https://housepredictor.streamlit.app/). Input the relevant features of the house, and the model will predict its price.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting house prices. While the current model performs well, there is always room for improvement through further data preprocessing and model refinement.
