# House Price Prediction üè†üí∞

Welcome to the House Price Prediction repository! This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. The machine learning model has been trained and deployed using Streamlit and scikit-learn. By leveraging this model, users can estimate the price of a house based on various features.

## Overview

The repository contains:

- Python Scripts: Python scripts for training the Linear Regression model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions.
- Streamlit App: User interface developed with Streamlit for interacting with the model and estimating house prices.
- Model: trained Linear Regression model for quick inference.
- Requirements.txt: List of dependencies to install the required packages.

## Demo

Please visit this site: https://housepredictor.streamlit.app/

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the House Price Prediction:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, navigate to the provided URL to access the user interface. Input the features of the house for which you want to estimate the price and obtain the prediction.
